2. Device driver people for some RTOS. a lot of people call themselves embedded, but have very limited capabilities, just writing board support packages for routers and the like under a common RTOS like Wind River. I&#039;m not sure what to learn here, but there are a lot of these guys and I mostly am just aware of them so I can avoid hiring them. They don&#039;t understand the electronics, aren&#039;t great programmers and tend not to flourish In smaller companies without extensive EE support. They also tend to dead end on hardware-software bugs. Don&#039;t be them.

Router BSP工程師臭了嗎?
